# nyTimesReactSearch

What this is:
This app is using the MERN stack. The app is about using react and express router to work with "mongodb" and "axios" to get data from the NYTIMES API. You can then save articles for future viewing and delete them when you are done.

Starting the app locally
Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in the root directory, run the following commands:

yarn install
cd client
yarn install
cd ..
``

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

yarn start


That's it, your app should be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.
